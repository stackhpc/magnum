deprecations:
  - |
    The 'magnum-api-wsgi' wsgi entrypoint has been deprecated will be removed
    in a future release. This is due to changes in Python packaging. Operators
    using the 'magnum-api-wsgi' should migrate away from it.  See the
    `OpenStack goverance page
    <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/proposed/migrate-from-wsgi-scripts-to-module-paths.html>`_
    for more info.
